# VortexCurves

This program has been made to simulate vortex curves in periodical systems with point interactions, as a part of Bachelor thesis under the name: „Vortex curves in systems with point interactions“ by Filip Breuer, under the Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering, Czech technical university in Prague, 2023.

TECHNICAL INFORMATIONS:
This program has been made in Wolfram Mathematica 13.2.
In order for the program to work properly, it is often necessary to adjust various parameters - these parameters are highlighted in code. To fit other arrangements than points on line, in lattice (square or hexagonal) it is necessary to modify this program accordingly.
