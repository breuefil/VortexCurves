# VortexCurves

INTRODUCTION:
This program has been made to simulate vortex curves in periodical systems with point interactions, as a part of Bachelor thesis under the name: „Vortex curves in systems with point interactions“ by Filip Breuer, under the Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering, Czech technical university in Prague, 2023.

TECHNICAL INFORMATIONS:

• This program has been made in Wolfram Mathematica 13.2.

• In order for the program to work properly, it is often necessary to adjust various parameters - these parameters are highlighted in code. To fit other arrangements than points on line, in lattice (square or hexagonal) it is necessary to modify this program accordingly.

• Programs for different configurations were made consecutively (points on line -> points in square grid -> points in hexagonal grid) and code underwent different enhancements along the way, therefore the last one (points in hexagonal grid) is most sophisticated and it is the best place to start aditional work eventually.
